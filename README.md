Project Name: Digital Calculator
Developer: Ansh Girdher
Language: Java
Technologies Used: Java Swing, exp4j (for mathematical expression evaluation), Launch4j, Inno Setup

Overview:
The Digital Calculator is a fully functional desktop application built using Java Swing. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and advanced operations like percentage calculations. The calculator also supports decimal operations and includes features like All Clear (AC) and Delete (DEL) for efficient input management.

Key Features:
Basic Arithmetic Operations:
* Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), and Percentage (%).

Advanced Input Handling:
* AC (All Clear): Clears the entire input field.
* DEL (Delete): Removes the last character from the input field.
* Decimal Support: Allows calculations with decimal numbers.
* Double Zero (00): Adds "00" to the input for quick number entry.

Error Handling:
* Handles invalid expressions and mathematical errors gracefully, displaying appropriate error messages.

Real-Time Expression Evaluation:
*Uses the exp4j library to evaluate mathematical expressions in real-time, ensuring accurate results.

User-Friendly Interface:
*Clean and intuitive layout with a large display area for input and results.
*Buttons are color-coded for better usability (orange for operators, white for numbers).

Deployment Tools:
*Launch4j: Used to wrap the Java application into a Windows executable (.exe) for easy distribution.
*Inno Setup: Used to create a professional installer for the application, simplifying the installation process for end-users.
